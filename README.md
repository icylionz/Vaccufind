# Vaccufind
This was a project done for a Computer Science course at the University of the West Indies. This website is a tool to aid in the vaccination process in Barbados. It alongs citizens to register for appointments, while providing a secure area for officials to view these patients' details, schedule their appointments, complete their appointments, add different types of vaccines and track the doses a patient receives. The website also prioritizes patients based on their occupation, heath conditions and age, which allows frontline workers and high-risk individuals to get priority on the waiting list. Depending on a patient's medical conditions, they will not be given a vaccine if that vaccine has been stated to not be compatible with those medical conditions.
